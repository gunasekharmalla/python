What is a Linked List?
============================
  => Linear data structure where elements (nodes) point to the next.
     Dynamic memory allocation (no fixed size like arrays).

Types of Linked Lists:
========================
-> Singly Linked List
-> Doubly Linked List
-> Circular Linked List (Singly and Doubly)

Basic Terms:
========================

-> Node
-> Head
-> Tail
-> Null/None reference

Stage 2: Singly Linked List
===================================

Creating a Node class
-> Inserting:
-> At the beginning
-> At the end
-> At a given position

Deleting:
-> From beginning
-> From end
-> Specific node

Traversal (printing the list)
-> Searching an element

Stage 3: Doubly Linked List
=====================================
=> Node structure (prev, data, next)
=> Insertion and deletion (all positions)
=> Reversing a doubly linked list

Stage 4: Circular Linked List
===========================================
-> Circular Singly vs Circular Doubly
-> Traversal (careful to avoid infinite loops)
-> Insert/Delete in circular list


Stage 5: Practice Problems
===========================================
Beginner:
Find length of linked list

Search an element

Reverse a linked list

Detect loop (Floydâ€™s Algorithm)

Intermediate:
===================================

Remove duplicates

Merge two sorted linked lists

Middle of the linked list

Intersection point in two linked lists

Advanced:
==============================================

LRU Cache (uses doubly linked list + hashmap)

Copy list with random pointer

Flatten a multilevel linked list

Sort a linked list (Merge Sort)

Stage 6: Master Tips
===================================================
Use recursion to reverse or print backward

Dry run pointer changes (especially in deletion)

Understand memory leaks and garbage collection (especially in python/C/C++)
