                                          Basic Questions from Beginner to Intermediate
                                      ======================================================
Basic:
===========

1. Basic Node Creation
2. Printing the Linked List
3. Insertion in a Singly Linked List
      There are three common types of insertion:
        =>Insert at the beginning
        =>Insert at the end
        =>Insert at a specific position/index
4. Deleting Nodes in a Singly Linked List
      We'll cover 3 common cases:
        =>Delete from the beginning
        =>Delete from the end
        =>Delete from a specific position
5. Reverse a Linked List
 Problem:
    Reverse the direction of a singly linked list.
    Example:
    10 â†’ 20 â†’ 30 â†’ None
    becomes
    30 â†’ 20 â†’ 10 â†’ None
 
6. ðŸ§© Problem:
You are given two singly linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
The digits are stored in forward order (i.e., most significant digit first).
Return the sum as a linked list in the same format.

âœ… Strategy:
1. Reverse both input lists.
2. Add them like we did earlier.
3. Reverse the result.
